/*Q3) Explain abstract class and interface with an example.
 * 		
 * 		=>  Abstract Class : - Abstract class in Java are the class defined with class keyword but with an addational keyword "abstract" 
 * this keyword specifies that there can be methods in this class which is not a "concrete method" and these methods needs to be to concretetised/
 * implemented before the use of these methods. We cannot create an Object of abstract class we can only inherit it for the implementaion and use of
 * its members. If in child class which inherits the abstract class we leave any member un-implementd then we need to declare the child class as
 * abstract too.  The major difference between an abstract class is that in abstract class we can also create concrete methods where as in interface
 * we cannot declare concrete class.
 * 
 *    =>	Interface :-  Interface are declared with the keyword "interface". It acts like the blueprint for the construction on class on which the
 *    interface is implemented . Every methods  in Interface is a abstract method and we cannot declare the method in interface unless it is declared 
 *    with static or default keyword . We can only declare the methods provided by interface if and only if we implement the interface into the 
 *    class and then in this class we need to implement this method any variable declared in interface is set to public static final .
